            <h3>Transit Guard</h3>
            <p>
              Transit Guard was incorporated on March 2, 1989 in Miami Gardens,
              FL to provide a high quality and low cost insurance product to the
              non-standard automobile insurance market. The company is family
              owned and it is one of the largest privately held property and
              casualty insurance companies in the United States.These trees are
              so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time
              stopping. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much
              harder. Be brave. The man who does the best job is the one who is
              happy at his job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone can paint. You can do anything here. So don't worry about
              it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a
              friend. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.
              That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions.
              That you can create the world that you want. Of course he's a
              happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. It's so
              important to do something every day that will make you happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.
              That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. That's
              crazy.
